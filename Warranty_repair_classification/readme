Determination of warranty repairs during regular maintenance with using Machine Learning models:

- CatBoostClassifier
- LGBMClassifier
- BaggingClassifier

At this point, the metrics need to be improved by adding additional features to the models.

Also, using SHAP diagrams, one can note the tendency of the model to define class 1 (warranty repair)
at high mileage values (mileage), and the tendency to define class 0 (no warranty repairs)
with a high number of days of operation from the date of sale (expl_days) and high in the serial
number maintenance (maintenance)
